                An argument I found interesting is that a significant factor behind the the decline of British economics performance, is due to an increase in regional inequality within the Uk. Supposedly, this has been growing year after year, particulary since the 1980s and 90s. The charts particulary emphasise this when showing the income growth in London compared to other regions of England.

<p>
    I have recreated a double axis chart showing the difference between oil prices and the production level worldwide. To improve the chart I have altered the title to be more descriptive and ensure the graph can be understood. I have also chnged the axis increments to be more consistent acroos the whole graph.
